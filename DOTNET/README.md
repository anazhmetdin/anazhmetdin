## ASP.NET Core MVC

[Food Delivery Web Application](https://github.com/anazhmetdin/FoodDeliveryWebApp)

In this application, my primary responsibility was to develop the seller interface. As part of this role, I successfully integrated ASP.NET Core SignalR to enable real-time push notifications for live orders.

Order items could be expanded:

Additionally, I utilized Chart.js to create visually appealing and informative graphs, providing sellers with valuable insights into their performance over time.

Moreover, I designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for efficient management of a seller's items, incorporating quick and intuitive controls like filters, sales application, and availability modification. These controls are used alongside a fixed header at the top with anchor links to all available categories.

Finally, I added a section in the customer homepage to display trending sellers (those with the highest order rates in the last few days). This section is updated regularly using a timed hosted service that runs in the background.
